So it finally happened. You.. you the alpha and omega made a mistake. How is that even possible ?
You did everything that came to your mind. Everything should work just fine!! And yet it was not enough..

The sore feeling of defeat.. slowly munching on your confidence.

Yea, every passionate developer was there. Sad view. For some it came sooner for some later, but it was inevitable.

## So what now ? 

First you have to accept that **you will make mistakes**! Sure, the more experience you have, the less mistakes you will make, but they will never disappear completely.



The most important thing you can take from this whole situation is to not make the same mistake again. Learn from it.
And to do that first thing you should do is to replicate the bug yourself and when you do that write a failing test for that bug.
