Over the course of past few months (2019) I've been a part of the core DevOps team in my organization. Despite being
responsible for my previous project CI/CD and monitoring I felt like I should improve more in this field.
There is only so much things you can learn from maintaining a simple project (at least for me after two years).

I felt like I need a bigger challenge. Learning how our core system works takes months. Maintaining it was a completely different
cup of tea to what I was used to. Huge platform consisting of thousands of machines accompanied with a complex monitoring system.
All of that spread around the world and binded with deployment pipelines, infrastructure and configuration management.

Slowly but surely I was getting more and more familiar with things. The more I learnt the more some things became easier to spot.
Things that seem important (if I would were to ever create such an ecosystem myself).

## Infrastructure Management
