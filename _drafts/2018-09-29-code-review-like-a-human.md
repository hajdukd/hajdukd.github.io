# Going a little back in time

When i started my first job as a software developer i didn't really pay much attention to the quality of the code but rather if it simply does what it should.
The amount of work didn't really help with that either - we were always behind the schedule. Ofcourse there were "code reviews" but looking back those were not really well executed.
Composition of the team at the time was: two juniors, one tester, two regulars and one lead. Feature after feature, bugfix after bugfix, tests, deployment and repeat kind of job.

In the end everything "did what it should" but each next iteration was longer. Modifications were more painful to introduce and fixing bugs uhg, you probably understand where im heading to..
Around that time my fellow junior teammate borrowed me the Clean Code by Uncle Bob. So i read it in between lectures and exchanged my thoughts with him afterwards.
We both loved to code so our next mission was to introduce what we learnt from the book in our project.

Ow boy.. was it a wild ride. At first we started to practice  



Over the years my approach to the code changed. Probably because of the people i had the pleasure to meet.
