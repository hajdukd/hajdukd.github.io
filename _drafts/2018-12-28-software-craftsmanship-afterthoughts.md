title: 'The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride'
---

Some of us Software Developers _REALLY_ care about "what" we do and "how" we do it. The book written by Sandro Mancuso
is a pure essence of exactly that - _the guideline_ for such fulfillment.

Whether you are an experienced developer or completely new to the field, because of a share amount of insight knowledge stored within
this title, it is a _MUST READ_ position.

## What is a Software Craftsmanship ?

The idea of work excellence is not new. All kinds of craftsmen honed their skills in a pursuit of the "Master" title.
This was the case for many medieval callings:
 - blacksmithing
 - armorsmithing
 - furriery
 - shoemaking
 - painting
 - sculpture
 
and many more.

It was a long and hard process. An apprenticeship often took years and one was not guaranteed to ever finish it with a title.

Sometimes students had to "set off" on a journey to train and hone their skills under multiple masters. That was the only way
to find the excellence they sought.

That were the old days, but how it looks right now ?

It is similar, people rediscover that truth over and over. In our case (IT) we want to be proud and recognized for what we do.
We want to grow together and share. We want to help our clients reach their goals. We want to be seen as _professionals_.

This is the Software Craftsmanship and this is what we should aim at as a community.
