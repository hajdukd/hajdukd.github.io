## Internet speed over the years

download speed is increasing

## Page responsiveness

libraries change weekly
web pages are less and less responsive over time (gmail)
new features !! but do we really need them

## protecting new developers

developers are being protected more and more by browsers, which in the long run make developers oblivious to what they are doing

## solution

It's hard to find a good solution to this problem.
On the one hand we have continues need of new developers because the web is expanding rapidly
but on the other hand those developers introduce more and more cluttered and exploitable sites.
